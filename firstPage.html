        <h1> MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES </h1>  

        <h3>Lao Tzu</h3>
        <p><strong>Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes.</strong> Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. 
        Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.</p>

        <h3>Marie Curie </h3>
        <p><strong>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.</strong> 
        Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.</p>
